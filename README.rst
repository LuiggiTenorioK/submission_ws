What is DRMAAtic?
==================

DRMAAtic is a Django REST server application that integrates with the `Distributed Resource Management Application API <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRMAA>`_
(DRMAA) standard through `drmaa-python <https://github.com/pygridtools/drmaa-python>`_.

DRMAAtic provides an interface to manage scripts, jobs and files. Also, it supports SLURM native specification to provide job dependencies and limit resource usage.
